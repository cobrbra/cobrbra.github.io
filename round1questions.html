    "Our whole lives we are told that you can achieve so much more when you work as a team. Why is it that when we are given the option between working together to achieve a solution and winging it on our own we decide we are better to go it alone than as a team....disappointing result to say the least!"<br>

    "Shocked, appalled and disappointed. Woke up this morning and thought it was all a dream, but no, the country really has voted in favour of Farage, Johnson and Gove.
We’ve stopped the free movement of our people, Japan has already stopped trading with us and the pound is at its lowest level since the 80s.<br>
Farage has backtracked on his figures for the NHS, saying there’s no way he can guarantee £350million a day, which played a huge part in the Leave Campaign’s scaremongering tactics and propaganda.<br>
We’ve chosen to leave the biggest and most successful peace project the world has ever seen, and I fail to see how some people thought this was the right decision to make. Immigration is a good thing, without it we wouldn’t have a large portion of our doctors, surgeons, teachers, scientists and friends. Most people in this country can’t claim to be 100% British. <br>
To make things worse, it’s not my generation that voted this way, but it is my generation that will be most affected. <br>
So thank you baby boomers, for yet another thing my generation will have to suffer with thanks to you. I hope you’re happy.
